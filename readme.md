# Purpose #

The purpose of the [STLINK/V2](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/hardware-development-tools/development-tool-hardware-for-mcus/debug-hardware-for-mcus/debug-hardware-for-stm32-mcus/st-link-v2.html?sc=stlinkv2) 
breakout board is to allow the user to easily connect the STLINK/V2 to the target without having to leave a large space for the 20-pin
STLINK/V2 socket.

# Status #

The board is 1.38" x 0.61", which is about as small as you could make it and still fit the large 20-pin connector.

# Maturity #

Although I have no reason to suspect that the board will not work as designed, it has not yet been tested.
